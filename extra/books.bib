abstract = {High-energy physics experiments, such as the compact muon solenoid (CMS) at the large hadron collider (LHC), have large-scale data processing computing requirements. The grid has been chosen as the solution. One important challenge when using the grid for large-scale data processing is the ability to monitor the large numbers of jobs that are being executed simultaneously at multiple remote sites. The relational grid monitoring architecture (R-GMA) is a monitoring and information management service for distributed resources based on the GMA of the Global Grid Forum. We report on the first measurements of R-GMA as part of a monitoring architecture to be used for batch submission of multiple Monte Carlo simulation jobs running on a CMS-specific LHC computing grid test bed. Monitoring information was transferred in real time from remote execution nodes back to the submitting host and stored in a database. In scalability tests, the job submission rates supported by successive releases of R-GMA improved significantly, approaching that expected in full-scale production.},

abstract = {High energy physics experiments, such as the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, have large-scale data processing requirements, with data accumulating at a rate of 1 Gbyte/s. This load comfortably exceeds any previous processing requirements and we believe it may be most efficiently satisfied through grid computing. Furthermore the production of large quantities of Monte Carlo simulated data provides an ideal test bed for grid technologies and will drive their development. One important challenge when using the grid for data analysis is the ability to monitor transparently the large number of jobs that are being executed simultaneously at multiple remote sites. R-GMA is a monitoring and information management service for distributed resources based on the grid monitoring architecture of the Global Grid Forum. We have previously developed a system allowing us to test its performance under a heavy load while using few real grid resources. We present the latest results on this system running on the LCG 2 grid test bed using the LCG 2.6.0 middleware release. For a sustained load equivalent to 7 generations of 1000 simultaneous jobs, R-GMA was able to transfer all published messages and store them in a database for 98\% of the individual jobs. The failures experienced were at the remote sites, rather than at the archiver's MON box as had been expected},

In order to operate such future power systems securely and efficiently it will be necessary to monitor and control output levels and scheduling when connecting such generation to a power system especially when it is typically embedded at the distribution level. Traditional monitoring and control technology that is currently employed at the transmission level is highly centralized and not scalable to include such significant increases in distributed and embedded generation. However, this paper proposes and demonstrates the adoption of a relatively new technology 'grid computing' that can provide both a scalable and universally adoptable solution to the problems associated with the distributed monitoring and control of future power systems},

abstract={ In grid computing environments, CPU performance discovery and allocation is a serious issue. Before they run their applications, grid users need to choose grid nodes based on available CPUs performance. Hence a tool is needed for measuring CPUs performance. To address this need, GcpSensor (grid CPU performance sensor) was developed. GcpSensor runs a typical benchmark program in every grid node to measure CPU performance and returns a metric named WMFLOPS which can be used to compare different CPUs performance directly. An algorithm, which can choose a moderate computation cost dynamically, is designed to ensure that every test is comprehensive and the added overhead is comparatively small. Our experiments have proved that GcpSensor can indicate the CPU performance sensitively and that users can use the GcpSensor data to compare different CPUs performance straightforward, thus the accuracy and efficiency for selecting computing resources are increased.},

abstract={High-performance execution in distributed computing environments often requires careful selection and configuration not only of computers, networks, and other resources but also of the protocols and algorithms used by applications. Selection and configuration in turn require access to accurate, up-to-date information on the structure and state of available resources. Unfortunately no standard mechanism exists for organizing or accessing such information. Consequently different tools and applications adopt ad hoc mechanisms, or they compromise their portability and performance by using default configurations. We propose a Metacomputing Directory Service that provides efficient and scalable access to diverse, dynamic, and distributed information about resource structure and state. We define an extensible data model to represent required information and present a scalable, high-performance, distributed implementation. The data representation and application programming interface are adopted from the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; the data model and implementation are new. We use the Globus distributed computing toolkit to illustrate how this directory service enables the development of more flexible and efficient distributed computing services and applications},

abstract = {Grid technologies enable large-scale sharing of resources within formal or informal consortia of individuals and/or institutions: what are sometimes called virtual organizations. In these settings, the discovery, characterization, and monitoring of resources, services, and computations are challenging problems due to the considerable diversity; large numbers, dynamic behavior, and geographical distribution of the entities in which a user might be interested. Consequently, information services are a vital part of any Grid software infrastructure, providing fundamental mechanisms for discovery and monitoring, and hence for planning and adapting application behavior. We present an information services architecture that addresses performance, security, scalability, and robustness requirements. Our architecture defines simple low-level enquiry and registration protocols that make it easy to incorporate individual entities into various information structures, such as aggregate directories that support a variety of different query languages and discovery strategies. These protocols can also be combined with other Grid protocols to construct additional higher-level services and capabilities such as brokering, monitoring, fault detection, and troubleshooting. Our architecture has been implemented as MDS-2, which forms part of the Globus Grid toolkit and has been widely deployed and applied},

This correlation has a variety of uses in performance analysis, including hand tuning, compiler optimization, debugging, benchmarking, monitoring, and performance modeling.

abstract = {Grid is an emerging technology for enabling resource sharing and coordinated problem solving in dynamic multi-institutional heterogeneous virtual organizations. Grid computing is being adopted in various areas from academic, industry research to government use. Grids are becoming platforms for high performance and distributed computing. Grid computing is the next generation IT infrastructure that promises to transform the way organizations and individuals compute, communicate and collaborate. The goal of Grid computing is to create the illusion of a simple but large and powerful self-managing virtual computer out of a large collection of connected heterogeneous systems sharing various combinations of resources. One of the fundamental operations needed to support location-independent computing is resource monitoring. Grid Resource Monitoring is the process of collecting information concerning the characteristics and status of resources of interest. In the Grid environment, resources may belong to different institutions, have different usage policies and pose different requirements on acceptable requests. Grid resources may dynamically join and leave, their membership varies over time; even in fairly static settings, resource availability is subject to failures. Given this transient nature, users must be supported in finding and keeping track of resources of interest; which is the main purpose of Grid Information Services (GIS). In order for information services to address the mentioned user needs, they must systematically collect information regarding the current and, sometimes, past status of Grid resources. In addition to information services, monitoring is also crucial in a variety of cases such as scheduling, data replication, accounting, performance analysis and optimization of distributed systems or individual applications, self-tuning applications, and many more. Also, given the increasing number of Grid resources, real-time monitoring of their availability and utilization is becoming essential for effective management, particularly regarding the detection of faults and bottlenecks. Focus of this thesis is to analyze existing Resource Monitoring Systems for Grid environment and an Agent-Based Resource Monitoring System has been proposed, designed and implemented for Grid environment.},

The development of free software license tools and services for terminal services, encourage us to reconsider the above change. Thin client computing model is being examined again, through the use of special technologies that allow us to re-distribute the load from desktops to server systems. Our goal is to increase the central control of the resources that are needed to operate a student class, having in mind the freedom of students to use the exact same tools as in fat clients. Easier roll-out and update of such tools is the key to decide whether or not thin client computing using free software license services is the right choice for education.},
