abstract = {High-energy physics experiments, such as the compact muon solenoid (CMS) at the large hadron collider (LHC), have large-scale data processing computing requirements. The grid has been chosen as the solution. One important challenge when using the grid for large-scale data processing is the ability to monitor the large numbers of jobs that are being executed simultaneously at multiple remote sites. The relational grid monitoring architecture (R-GMA) is a monitoring and information management service for distributed resources based on the GMA of the Global Grid Forum. We report on the first measurements of R-GMA as part of a monitoring architecture to be used for batch submission of multiple Monte Carlo simulation jobs running on a CMS-specific LHC computing grid test bed. Monitoring information was transferred in real time from remote execution nodes back to the submitting host and stored in a database. In scalability tests, the job submission rates supported by successive releases of R-GMA improved significantly, approaching that expected in full-scale production.},

abstract = {High energy physics experiments, such as the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, have large-scale data processing requirements, with data accumulating at a rate of 1 Gbyte/s. This load comfortably exceeds any previous processing requirements and we believe it may be most efficiently satisfied through grid computing. Furthermore the production of large quantities of Monte Carlo simulated data provides an ideal test bed for grid technologies and will drive their development. One important challenge when using the grid for data analysis is the ability to monitor transparently the large number of jobs that are being executed simultaneously at multiple remote sites. R-GMA is a monitoring and information management service for distributed resources based on the grid monitoring architecture of the Global Grid Forum. We have previously developed a system allowing us to test its performance under a heavy load while using few real grid resources. We present the latest results on this system running on the LCG 2 grid test bed using the LCG 2.6.0 middleware release. For a sustained load equivalent to 7 generations of 1000 simultaneous jobs, R-GMA was able to transfer all published messages and store them in a database for 98\% of the individual jobs. The failures experienced were at the remote sites, rather than at the archiver's MON box as had been expected},

abstract = {Classical approaches to implement Grid resource information service (GRIS) are either centralized or hierarchical. It will result in problems of scalability and single point of failure as the scale of Grid systems rapidly increases. To address scalability and reliability of Grid Resource Information Service, we proposed a distributed resource information service model that extends the information service architecture of GT4 based on superpeer model which is one of the P2P techniques. In the results of our simulation experiments, it observed that this model has high scalability and robustness. Future we will implement it in our MICE-G Grid system.},

@book{Taylor2006,
abstract = {It is now widely accepted within the electrical power supply industry that future power systems operates with significantly larger numbers of small-scale highly dispersed generation units that use renewable energy sources and also reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In order to operate such future power systems securely and efficiently it will be necessary to monitor and control output levels and scheduling when connecting such generation to a power system especially when it is typically embedded at the distribution level. Traditional monitoring and control technology that is currently employed at the transmission level is highly centralized and not scalable to include such significant increases in distributed and embedded generation. However, this paper proposes and demonstrates the adoption of a relatively new technology 'grid computing' that can provide both a scalable and universally adoptable solution to the problems associated with the distributed monitoring and control of future power systems},

abstract={ In grid computing environments, CPU performance discovery and allocation is a serious issue. Before they run their applications, grid users need to choose grid nodes based on available CPUs performance. Hence a tool is needed for measuring CPUs performance. To address this need, GcpSensor (grid CPU performance sensor) was developed. GcpSensor runs a typical benchmark program in every grid node to measure CPU performance and returns a metric named WMFLOPS which can be used to compare different CPUs performance directly. An algorithm, which can choose a moderate computation cost dynamically, is designed to ensure that every test is comprehensive and the added overhead is comparatively small. Our experiments have proved that GcpSensor can indicate the CPU performance sensitively and that users can use the GcpSensor data to compare different CPUs performance straightforward, thus the accuracy and efficiency for selecting computing resources are increased.},

abstract={High-performance execution in distributed computing environments often requires careful selection and configuration not only of computers, networks, and other resources but also of the protocols and algorithms used by applications. Selection and configuration in turn require access to accurate, up-to-date information on the structure and state of available resources. Unfortunately no standard mechanism exists for organizing or accessing such information. Consequently different tools and applications adopt ad hoc mechanisms, or they compromise their portability and performance by using default configurations. We propose a Metacomputing Directory Service that provides efficient and scalable access to diverse, dynamic, and distributed information about resource structure and state. We define an extensible data model to represent required information and present a scalable, high-performance, distributed implementation. The data representation and application programming interface are adopted from the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; the data model and implementation are new. We use the Globus distributed computing toolkit to illustrate how this directory service enables the development of more flexible and efficient distributed computing services and applications},
