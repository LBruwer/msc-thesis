\section*{Abstract}
Develop an interface which allows the customisable aggregation and display and
information on the performance of a computational grid.

In EGI era of grid computing in Europe, MyEGEE and Nagios are taking the place
of SAM in performance monitoring of the grid, in NGI oriented infrastructures.
SAM Framework had a significant role in reporting the service availability.
That monitoring model was needed to be replaced by a new Multi Level Monitoring
architecture. The need of establishing a central point in regional level, where
metrics gathered from each information system of the grid, lead to the adoption
of MyOSG. MyEGEE is the tool that extends MyOSG to european NGI's and provides
an interface to customize the display of aggregated metrics of the performance
of NGI sites. Nagios is the main technological choice to provide that regional
monitoring system.
