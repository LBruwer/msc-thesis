\section{Grid Computing}
Grid computing \cite{li2005grid} is the most recent decade's technology
innovation in high performance computing. A large number of scientistcs working
on the operations of this huge co-operative project of EU. Monitoring \&
information architecture \cite{fisher2002datagrid} has been standardized in the
initial state of that project, to succeed in today scale of 150.000 cores in
production. Use of grid computing nowadays takes place in academic and research
environments. Also, applications in industry-based needs such as promising
Power Grid control \cite{Taylor2006} are emerging.

\section{Resource Brokers}
Resource Brokers \cite{Kertesz06ataxonomy} where developed to manage the
workload on Computer elements and Resource elements. Globus is a
non-service based RB, and gLite RB which is service based. A Workload
Management System (WMS) exists in gLite to do the distribution and management of
the Computing and Storage oriented tasks.

Based on the middleware that resource brokers rely on, they use the
equivalent information system. From resource broker's point of view, the
relevant information is the data store and query. There are two main categories
of information systems in middlewares. The Directory-based and the
Service-based. They are used for resource mapping by the brokers when they
access the resource data.

\subsection{Globus}

Globus Toolkit is an open source toolkit used to build grids. It provides
standards such as OGSA, OGSI, WSRF and GSI, and the implementations to OGF
protocols such as MDS and GRAM.

\nomenclature{MDS}{Monitoring and Discovery Service}
\nomenclature{GRAM}{Grid Resource Allocation \& Management Protocol}

Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS) is part of Globus Toolkit. It provides
the information for the availability and status of grid resources.

\subsection{gLite}

% copy apo wikipedia:
The Information System that is used in gLite 3.1 inherits its main concepts from
the Globus Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS).[5] However, the GRIS and GIIS
in MDS has been replaced by the Berkeley Database Information Index which is
essentially an OpenLDAP server that is updated by an external process.


\section{Information Services}

\end{figure}
A Grid Monitoring Architecture \cite{tierney2002grid} was proposed in early
2000's. Information systems were developed to create repositories of information
needed to be stored for monitoring and statistical reporting reasons. Such an
organized system later was specified by the Aggregated Topology Provider (ATP)
definition. The largest world grids adopt that model, forming OIM in OSG (USA)
and GOCDB as that information base in EGEE (Europe). Message Bus was also
defined as a mean to tranfer the undelying data, and well known tools came up
such as Gstat, GOCDB and BDII with Glue specification. Grid performance
monitoring and keeping of such an information system has also impact in the
performance of the system itshelf \cite{zhang2003performance}, so various
methods were developed to give the solution to the scalling and performance
problem, such as MDS2 (GIIS \& GRIS), GMA and R-GMA
\cite{wilson2004information}, which offers relational environment
\cite{fisher2001relational}, has experience on production systems 
\cite{byrom-production} and scales to reach huge needs such as CMS project
\cite{Bonacorsi2004,Byrom}.

\subsection{MDS}
Monitoring and Discovery Services is about collecting, distributing, indexing
and archiving information of the status of resources, services and
configurations. The collected information is used to detect new services and
resources, or to monitor the state of a system.

Globus Toolkit was using LDAP-based implementation for its information system
since its early versions, back in 1998 \cite{von1998usage}. MDS2 in Globus
Toolkit fully implemented referral with a combined GRIS and GIIS, using
mds-vo-name=local to refer to the GRIS and all other strings to refer to a
GIIS. It was widely accepted as a standard implementation of a grid information
system \cite{945188}, with good scalability and performance
\cite{zhang2004performance}.

\nomenclature{GIIS}{Grid Index Information Service}
\nomenclature{GRIS}{Grid Resource Information Service}

MDS4 includes WSRF implementations of the Index Service, a
Trigger Service, WebMDS (formerly known as the Web Service Data Browser) and the
underyling framework, the Aggregator Framework.

Web Services Resource Framework introduced an Aggregator Framework:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item MDS-Index, which provides a collection of services monitoring
  information and an interface to query such information.
  \item MDS-Trigger, which provides a mechanism to take action on collected
  information.
  \item MDS-Archive, is planned for future release of MDS, to provide access to
  archived data of monitoring information.
\end{enumerate}

External software components that are used to collect information (such as
Ganglia)\cite{gangliaWSRF} are called Information Providers.

\subsection{BDII}

% TODO to gLite monitoring me dika mou logia
The ability to monitor resource related parameters is currently considered a
necessary functionality in any network. In such a heterogeneous and complex
system as the Grid, this necessity becomes fundamental. A monitoring system
implies the existence of a central repository of operational information (in
WLCG/EGEE, the GOCDB). The monitoring system should be able to collect data from
the resources in the system, in order to analyze the usage, behavior and
performance of the Grid, detect and notify fault conditions, contract violations
and user-defined events.
The GOC web page contains a whole section
concerning monitoring information for WLCG/EGEE. Several different monitoring
tools are in use, including general-purpose monitoring tools and Grid specific
systems.
Also important are the web pages publishing the results of functional tests
applied periodically using the Service Availability Monitoring (SAM) to the all
the sites registered within WLCG/EGEE. The results of these tests show if a site
is responding correctly to standard Grid operations; otherwise, an investigation
on the cause of the unexpected results is undertaken. Some VOs may even decide
to automatically exclude from their BDII the sites that are not passing the
functional tests successfully, so that they do not appear in the IS and are not
considered for possible use by their applications.

\section{Performance Monitoring}
Standards are being published about the operational models that the grid
computing initiative will use. Last decade the EGEE I, II \& III was adopted by
european universities to fund and establish a collaborative community of
researchers under a central point, the CERN oriented research project in
Particle Physics. After EGEE, the European Grid Initiative were formed to lead
to the explode of that community into regional initiatives. Performance
and availability monitoring tools and views also follow that format, phasing out
commonly used SAM \cite{egee3dsa122} and having the adoption of Nagios as the
monitoring of regional performance tool.


A taxonomy effort has been made \cite{gerndt2004performance} to present the
differencies of performance monitoring systems of the grid, and later a more
general \cite{zanikolas2007importance} taxonomy paper was published to give a
more general visibility of these tools. GridICE was generaly used to aggregate
the performance metrics of ROCs in high level reports
\cite{andreozzi2005gridice}. Later GridICE was left as long as the SAM left, to
meet the milestone of EGI to have a regional monitoring tool (Nagios) to report
the reliability of the joined sites and report the values for SLA reasons.

\subsection{Ganglia}

\section{European Grid Infrastructure}
Latest EGI directive to form regional operation tools pushed the use of Nagios
\cite{imamagic2007grid} as the main tools of availability \& performance (an so
reliability) monitoring of the grid. Each NGI/ROC (regional level) has its own
interface, and hierarhicaly there is a Super Nagios interface to report the top
level view of general system availability. Nagios offers extensions such as NRPE
to remotely invoke check commands in inaccesible/private installations.
Another important add-on to Nagios is the NdoUtils, which offers an SQL store
of history data to the monitoring interface. Nagios Configuration Generator was
introduced to help the automaticaly generation of the configuration based on
the information system of nodes and services. Finally, there has been proposed
an integration of SAM views to a Nagios customized interface, to offer the last
good known SAM interface to the old users. Nagios also integrates with GGUS, a
ticketing system that european grid initiative uses.

By the end of the project the monitoring infrastructure (regional Nagios servers and the corresponding regional MyEGEE portals [R52], [R53]) will complete the transition process to a fully distributed infrastructure.
The Nagios-based system will totally replace the Service Availability Monitoring (SAM)
infrastructure. At the time of writing two monitoring environments are operated: a production one and a test one.


\subsection{NGS}
Brunel Univesity takes part in regional and european initiatives. 4 different
Computer Elements exist, and 3 Storage Elements, consisting the UKI-LT2-Brunel
site. LT2 stands for London Grid, a co-operation with other London Universities.
GridPP and NGS are two collaboration groups that Brunel Univesity is member of,
and papers on the web interface \cite{Hobson2007} and real time visualization of
the grid status were presented \cite{Huang2007} by GridPP
