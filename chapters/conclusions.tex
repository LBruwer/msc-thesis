\section{Conclusions}

LDAP without caching may be used in site level monitoring.
WSRF has caching and Indexer and Aggregator so it may be used for regional and top level monitoring


Conclusions should be based on an in depth critical analysis of the information presented in the dissertation and should be related to the objectives stated in the introduction.

do not simply summarize the dissertation

do not recapitulate the analysis or discussion

do not introduce new ideas

identify specific points that have been clarified or discovered, and specific actions to be taken

identify specific additional investigation that is required (and why)

It is important to remember that conclusions should only be drawn on the basis of the information presented in the dissertation. Generalized conclusions without supporting evidence are to be
discouraged.

\section{Further Work}
Identify specific additional investigation that is required to be carried out.

For testing purposes some URLs of other
